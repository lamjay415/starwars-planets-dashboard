# Goal

To create a simple dashboard that displays and visualizes data about Starwars' planets.

# Overview

There is a free API online that provides endpoints to fetch data about Starwars. Some of this data includes the people of Starwars, the spaceships, and the planets.

The API can be accessed here: [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev). On this site, you can run requests to see how the data is returned.

For this assignment, we will only be focusing on **planets**. There a total of **60** planets in the Starwars universe.

The only API endpoint that you will need to work with will be the planets endpoint (`https://swapi.dev/api/planets/`)

**HINT: The endpoint provided only fetches 10 planets, but there are 60 total. You will need to find a way to retrieve all 60. Pay attention closely to the data that is returned from the endpoint call.**

# Requirements

What we would like you to do is to create a **React** web page that displays a bar chart and a table of the planet's attributes.

The **bar chart** should only show the population of each planet.

The X Axis will be the planet's name.
The Y Axis will be the planet's population.

The **table** should show the following attributes of each planet:

- Name
- Population
- Rotation Period
- Orbital Period
- Diameter
- Climate
- Surface Water

The table and bar chart should be ordered alphabetically by the planet's name.

**Here are some optional (nice-to-have) features:**

- Pagination for the table (show 10 planets each page)
- Ability to choose to graph different attributes on the bar chart (rotation period, orbital period, etc)

You will need to use a graphing library to display the bar chart. There are many graphing libraries in JavaScript to choose from.

Here are some suggestions, but feel free to use whatever you want:

- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)
- [Chart.js](https://chartjs.org/)

Both Plotly & Chart.js have React wrapper libraries that you can use.

# Deliverables

- Please commit your code to a GitHub repository and share the link to [lee.derek@gene.com](mailto:lee.derek@gene.com) when completed
- Please verify that your code successfully loads before submitting
- You can start up the project with `create-react-app` (recommended).
- It is recommended that you write your components using React hooks.
- You are free to use any other libraries that you think may be needed for this project. All packages should be listed in the `package.json` for the project
- You can design the web page to any layout that you want.
- You can use any version of React.
